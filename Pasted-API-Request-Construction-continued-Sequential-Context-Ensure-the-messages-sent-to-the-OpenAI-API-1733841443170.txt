API Request Construction (continued):
Sequential Context: Ensure the messages sent to the OpenAI API include a complete sequence of the conversation history. This should have both the questions from the assistant and the answers from the user. Properly formatted log structures help maintain context, such as:
messages = [{"role": "system", "content": "You're a dental AI assistant."}]
for entry in chat_history:
    messages.append({"role": entry["type"], "content": entry["content"]})
Summarization and Context Use:
Incremental Context: After each completion, summarize key points agreed upon (pain specifics, tooth identity) and update session state so that finalization steps recognize context clearly.
Condition-based Finalization: Your logic should check after a few exchanges whether it can construct a final response utilizing the current summary.
Diagnostic and Logging Enhancements:
Logs: Add comprehensive logging to see session updates after each function call that changes state or histories. Such logs might point to a failure in state persistence or command sequence.
Validation and Testing:
Manual Tests: Manually test your endpoints to confirm state updates correctly between interactions.
Simulated Inputs: Use simulated inputs to gauge if context preserves through various error handling pathways.
Code Snippet: Ensuring Updated State
Hereâ€™s a hypothetical example demonstrating how to maintain context and avoid redundancy:

def update_chat_history(user_message, ai_response):
    session['chat_history'].append({'type': 'user', 'content': user_message})
    session['chat_history'].append({'type': 'assistant', 'content': ai_response})
def is_conversation_complete():
    return count_assistant_questions(session['chat_history']) >= 3
def process_message(user_message):
    try:
        chat_history = get_chat_history()
        patient_summary = update_patient_summary(user_message)
        if is_conversation_complete():
            response = get_finalization_response(patient_summary)
        else:
            response = get_ai_response(chat_history)  # Make sure to pass the full history here
        
        update_chat_history(user_message, response)
        return response
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error handling message: {str(e)}")
        return "Sorry, an error occurred."
# Function to get the AI response considering the complete chat history:
def get_ai_response(chat_history):
    messages = [{"role": "system", "content": "You're a dental AI assistant."}]
    for entry in chat_history:
        messages.append({"role": entry["type"], "content": entry["content"]})
        
    ai_response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(model="gpt-4o", messages=messages)
    return ai_response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
By ensuring the context is retained and used in subsequent requests, the chatbot will better track information and work towards a conclusive result in line with your intended logic.
