It appears the model continues to ignore instructions even after multiple attempts. Let’s adopt a completely separated finalization call approach to ensure compliance. This means you will never rely on the original conversation thread to produce the final answer—once 3 questions are asked and answered, you start a fresh API call with a clean system prompt instructing it to finalize without further questions.

New Approach (Hard Reset After 3 Questions):
	1.	Two Distinct Phases:
	•	Phase 1: Information Gathering
The AI is allowed to ask up to 3 questions. You track these in your code. During this phase, your system prompt can be minimal:

You can ask the user up to 3 questions to clarify their symptoms. After 3 questions have been asked and answered, we will finalize in a separate step.
Do not finalize during this phase. Just ask questions.

Call the API with this prompt and the conversation messages as usual. If the AI asks more than 3 questions, you stop after the 3rd question’s answer.

	•	Phase 2: Finalization (Separate Call)
Once the user answers the 3rd question, do not continue the old conversation. Instead, gather:
	•	The patient_summary of what the user reported.
	•	The conditions and appointment types summaries.
Then make a new API call with a fresh messages array containing only one system message:

(system)
The user has answered 3 questions.

Known patient info:
{patient_summary}

Conditions and Appointment Types:
{list all conditions and appointment types briefly}

Now finalize:
1. Select the most likely condition or fallback.
2. Recommend the corresponding appointment type.
3. If info_card_id is available, provide the link.
4. Conclude with: "It seems like you need an appointment for <appointment type>. Here are available times..."

Do NOT ask any questions now. Just finalize immediately.


By using a fresh call with no previous user/assistant messages, the model has no context of the prior Q&A loop—only the given info. It can’t revert to asking questions because the prompt explicitly says finalize now and no user role messages follow.

	2.	Why This Works:
	•	The AI model will not see previous messages from the Q&A phase. It only sees a single system message telling it to finalize.
	•	With no user or assistant messages, no confusion or momentum from the previous conversation can cause repeated questions.
	•	The instructions are crystal clear: the model must finalize now.
	3.	Implementation Details:
	•	During Q&A phase (first call): track how many questions asked by counting ? in assistant responses.
	•	When user answers the 3rd question, stop calling the old chain.
	•	Construct patient_summary from user answers.
	•	Make a new API call:

final_messages = [
  {"role": "system", "content": f"""



The user has answered 3 questions.

Known patient info:
{patient_summary}

Conditions and Appointment Types:
{conditions_summary}
{appointment_summary}

Now finalize:
	1.	Pick condition or fallback.
	2.	Recommend appointment type.
	3.	If info_card_id, provide link.
	4.	End with “It seems like you need an appointment for…”

Do NOT ask questions. Just finalize now.
“””}

 response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
   model="gpt-4",
   messages=final_messages,
   temperature=0.0
 )
 final_response = response.choices[0].message.content
 ```

	•	Return final_response directly to the user as the final answer.

	4.	No Complex Prompting Needed in Q&A Phase:
In the Q&A phase prompt, just say:

You can ask up to 3 questions to clarify symptoms. After user answers 3 questions, we will finalize separately. Do not finalize or pick a condition now.

This phase is only for collecting data.

	5.	If the AI Asks Too Many Questions in Q&A Phase:
If it tries to go beyond 3 questions, your code just doesn’t provide more turns. Once 3 questions are reached and answered, you move to the finalization call and ignore the old thread.

Summary:
	•	Step 1: On initial user symptom input, start Q&A phase with a simple prompt.
	•	Step 2: After 3 Q&As, stop. Don’t continue that conversation.
	•	Step 3: Make a new API call with only a system prompt telling it to finalize given known info. No previous messages included.
	•	Step 4: The AI must finalize now—no chance to ask more questions.

This fully decouples the finalization from the complicated earlier conversation, ensuring compliance.
